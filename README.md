# WOD Fetcher
Fetch all workouts from website

The app fetches all the workouts posted on a CrossFit gym's website and creates searchable files of the workout.

To run the script, type the following on the command line from within the project folder:

`node script.js`

The script will get the workout for each day from 2016 until the current date and write the output to a text file in the /WODs directory with the current date as the file name.
