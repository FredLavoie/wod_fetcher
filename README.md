# WOD Fetcher
Fetch all workouts from website

Using the command line tool curl, the app fetches all the workouts posted on a CrossFit gym's website and creates searchable files of the workout.

To run the script, type the following on the command line from within the project folder:

`node script.js <year> <month> <day>`

Each argument is either a specific year, month,  or 'all'. If all is selected, the data will be fetched from 2016 to the current year.
